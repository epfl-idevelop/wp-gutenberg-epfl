A plugin for Wordpress which provides multiple blocks for EPFL services. It is based on [Wordpress Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg).

Once you have the sources in place, the standard workflow is:

- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Start development builds: `npm start`
- Develop. Test. Repeat.
- Create production build: `npm run build`
